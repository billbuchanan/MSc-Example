\section*{Acknowledgements}

It is normal to thank those who have given help and support (typically your supervisor should
get a kind mention!). Keep acknowledgements short and business-like, but do take care to
remember all those who deserve credit. This is especially important where outside agencies
are involved, or where experimental work has been carried out. Remember to include the
names of proof-readers.
